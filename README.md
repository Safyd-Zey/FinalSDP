# FinalSDP
In the final project on Software Design Patterns, we created a project containing 6 patterns - Singleton pattern, Strategy pattern, Decorator pattern, Adapter pattern, Factory method pattern, Observer pattern. 
The essence of the project is an application for a hardware store for sellers and buyers. Each pattern was used logically and related to the theme of the project.
singleton:
Use of a single inventory by the administration. Each admin can have his own access to the inventory (a separate object), but changes in his object affect the entire inventory, because it's all one object
decorator:
Discounts: holiday, preferential, for regular customers. You can add discounts and they add up
strategy:
When ordering something, you can specify delivery: pickup, standard, express
adapter:
The idea is that under the old system a product could only be found by barcode, but now it can be found by name
factory method:
You can create a product without creating a specific object, that is, it is enough to change one word to change the object
observer:
Subscribers subscribe to the newsletter and receive notifications when a new unique product arrives or when a product runs out
